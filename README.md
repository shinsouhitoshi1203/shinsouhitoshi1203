wanna see other hidden repositories? sure, [click me](https://github.com/shinsouhitoshi1203?tab=repositories) 

also, i had some other projects (it was made like 4 yrs ago and certainly the interface wasn't as good as now). unfortunately, i lost the source of the projects so i couldn't upload on github. therefore, ill upload the videos of projects

links are [**here**](//)

## my website portfolio
i used to have an old portfolio website - narawat.tk *(it was an old one, plus it had been hosted before freenom ended its service :skull:, just to emphasize)*, written mostly in PHP.

if you wish to see the proof, i still have the [~~*wayback* website~~](https://web.archive.org/web/20230725115346/https://www.narawat.tk/en/welcome).

~~here is [the copy of the site](http://sinnohsatoshi.click) (w/ some modification)~~ (nothing)

im too lazy to make a new portfolio, so i'll just leave it here.


## docs for dev-learning
mdn is still the best documentation website for web development, i have to admit. but the thing is, i don't like spending too much time comprehending technical terms. therefore, i decided to write the document in plain english *(sigh)* for my self-training. i'm glad if the docs help you in your training.
| document name  | document link  |
|---|---|
|  (SCSS) Grid system tutorial | [**Link**](https://github.com/shinsouhitoshi1203/sass-grid-system/blob/6eaf0246a57c0db78e25ffcc380a0c1c3140426f/readme.md)  |
